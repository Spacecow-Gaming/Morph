Morph
=========

A game written using the Irrlicht rendering engine, only on Linux at the moment.

The premise of the game is that objects are "Morphed" into other objects, allowing, for instance, a ball to roll down a slope, then transform into a cube, allowing the player character to use it to advance to an exit.

Needs a Windows port, badly. I'm not even sure how anyone else can contribute to this unless Windows.
